                    Greetings Everyone!<br> 
                My name is Brandon Lee Red Shirt. I am 33 years old. And I already know you may have a couple of questions. 
                So let me take this time to asnwer them for you. Yes my last name is Native American. 
                I am part of the Oglala Sioux tribe from the Pine Ridge Reservation in south west South Dakota. 
                Also, I am related to an actual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Shirt_(Oglala)" target="_blank">Chief.</a>
                I was born in Denver. I grew up in the La Alma neighborhood of off Colfax and Kalamath. 
                I graduated from Denver South High School in 2003.

                <p>
                    After high school I took a two year hiatus working odd jobs until I decided to get my life together 
                and joined the military. In the military I was a AH-64D Apache Attack Helicopter mechanic. During my six year 
                contract I was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Also, I was stationed overseas in the Republic of Korea for a year.
                When my initial contract was completed I joined the Army Reserve and became a Warrant Officer to fly UH-60M Blackhawk 
                helicopters. After I separated from the military I went out and earned my civilian Airframe and Powerplant certification to 
                perform maintenance legally on aircraft. I moved to Germany for work as a helicopter mechanic. I was based out of
                small medieval town called Rothenberg ob der Tauber. After my contract was up I moved back to the U.S. to complete some educational
                goals and this is where I find myself at Galvanize now.
